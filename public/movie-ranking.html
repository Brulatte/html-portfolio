<h1>The Best Movies According to Johanna</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Man From Snowy River</h3>
<p>This is a great cowboy movie about loss, love, proving oneself, and working hard to reach your goals.</p>
<h3>Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron</h3>
<p>I've loved this one since I was a kid. The music by Hans Zimmer is incredible and this horse's resilience is to be
    admired.</p>
<h3>The Holiday</h3>
<p>Christmas themed movie with romance, comedy, and Jack Black.</p>
